# .gitignore for a PHP project with Composer and Tailwind CSS

# Composer dependencies
# This directory contains all the PHP libraries installed by Composer.
# It should always be ignored, and 'composer install' should be run on deployment.
/vendor/

# Node.js dependencies
# This directory contains all the JavaScript packages installed by npm (for Tailwind).
# It should always be ignored, and 'npm install' should be run on deployment.
/node_modules/

# Tailwind CSS build output
# This is the generated CSS file. It's a build artifact and should not be versioned.
# The source file (e.g., /src/input.css) is what should be tracked.
/dist/

# Environment variables file
# This file often contains sensitive information like database passwords or API keys.
# It should never be committed to version control. A .env.example file should be
# created instead to show what variables are needed.
.env

# Composer lock file
# Committing composer.lock ensures that everyone on the team uses the exact
# same versions of dependencies. It's generally recommended to commit this file.
# However, for libraries, it's common to ignore it. Uncomment if you want to ignore.
# /composer.lock
